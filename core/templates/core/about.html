<p class="lead container-sm">
	<q>- Ohh, just google it!</q>

        At this point, the word "google" had become a common noun. We live in the Big Data Era, in
        which practically all information is accessible via the internet. We use search to locate any
        query, no matter how simple. Google is now the most well-known search engine. Those who
        value their privacy more than anything else may prefer DuckDuckGO over Google. However,
        from time to time, each of those search engines gets caught by purchasing private data. I want
        to be able to control and safeguard my personal information. It is essential that you secure
        yourself from "bad eyes". That's why Iâ€™m implementing my own search engine.

    <h4 class="text-center mt-sm-5"><strong>Introduction</strong></h4>

    <p class="lead container-sm">
    An online search engine is a data retrieval system that saves information from several
websites. Since the advent of the World Wide Web, search engines have made important
contributions to the search for information on the internet. They assist in swiftly accessing
information on the internet. However, there are several ways to enhance it. Web search
engines do not take into account the individual demands of users; instead, each user is treated
similarly. It is becoming increasingly harder for an online search engine to determine what a
user truly desires. When many users submit the same inquiry to a typical search engine, the
results will be the same regardless of which user submitted the query. Users require
information depending on their interests while searching for information on the web. It is
tough to communicate to the search engine what we, the users, genuinely desire.
        <br>
    As the Web progresses at an alarmingly rapid pace, information expands at a dizzying rate.
The volume of information on the internet is quickly increasing, as is the number of new users
who are unfamiliar with the art of web research.
        <br>
    I've suggested a method in which the user enters content or picture search terms. If the
algorithm identifies matching content or images, it will match the term. The system will show
the user that material and image. The user may search for information more quickly. The
system is user-friendly; any user may use it.

    <h4 class="text-center mt-sm-5"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h4>
<p class="lead container-sm">
The <strong>Raw Search</strong>  project was finished successfully. The system was created with great care and
is error-free, while also being efficient and time-saving. The goal of this project was to create
a web application that could search for data throughout the whole internet. Search engines
help in finding information on the web as quickly as possible. But still, there are certain ways
to improve it. This project provided me with useful information and practical expertise on a
variety of topics, including creating web pages in HTML, CSS, and Python; using responsive
templates; developing a full-stack Django application; and database administration in SQLite3
and PostgreSQL. The entire system has been safeguarded. In addition, the project helped me
comprehend project development phases and the software development life cycle. I learned
how to test many components of a project. This project has given me a lot of happiness
because I was able to create an application that can be used to help people. However,
designing to implement an application utilizing a new technology was extremely difficult. It is
difficult to let the search engine know what the user actually wants.
